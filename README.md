# Scraper ProfitTrailer Settings

Welcome to the home of ...

**1) The main buy strat** is EMAGAIN with a negative buy value to buy into dips based on 5min candle size, on ProfitTrailer 2 this is supported by a second buy trigger RSI on 15min candle size to have a better buy point from the get go. Also to note are the indicators, these have been fine tuned by heavy backtesting on TradingView, as has the trailing.

**2) The sell strat** is just a simple GAIN but with a very tiny minimum profit value - one of the key elements to bag up less, as often we will buy only into tiny swings. Once we start forcing PT to wait for those tripple digit profits (you wish) we will often force it into holding an altcoin for a pretty long time. During that whole time the chance of anything happening (altcoin tanking, market tanking etc.) will go up exponentially - so we try to avoid that and will be happy with every little % we can accumulate.

The same reasoning stands behind NO TRAILING on PT1, as PT1 does not have any timeouts (sadly) for trailing so in turn we quite often "miss" a good sell opportunity and end up with the same problem I just outlined.

NOTE: For ProfitTrailer2 trailing is enabled and will give better daily profit numbers - PT2 has the abbility to "timeout" the trailing using the take_profit setting, so we are still able to trail with the uptrend a little bit, but if it lingers on for too long we will take what we can get and get out!
